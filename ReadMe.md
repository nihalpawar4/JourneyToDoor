Welcome to my GATE 2024 CSE Exam Preparation Repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of my journey, study materials, and resources as I prepare for the upcoming GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) examination in Computer Science and Engineering.

## About GATE:

The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is a prestigious national-level examination conducted jointly by the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) on behalf of the National Coordination Board - GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India. GATE is a gateway for admission to postgraduate programs in prestigious institutions and also serves as a benchmark to evaluate the technical knowledge of candidates in various engineering and science disciplines.
